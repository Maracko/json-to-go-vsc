# JSON to Go

## This extension helps you convert JSON data to a Go type definition

#### It exposes multiple commands that can be run through the pallete or added to a hotkey. The base command is `JSON to Go: Convert`.

#### By default the extension will convert complex JSON automatically when pasting into a Go file.

### Settings

#### In v1.0.0 many new settings have been added, such as saving a copy of every conversion. I won't list them here anymore, but you are encouraged to check and configure them to your likings. There is a shortcut command `JSON to Go: Open settings`
