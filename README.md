# JSON to Go

A very simple extension that will let you convert <em>selected</em> text to a Go struct if it's valid JSON.

Can be run through the command pallete or the editor context menu inside supported files with the <strong>JSON to Go command</strong>

This is the initial release and I welcome any suggestions.
