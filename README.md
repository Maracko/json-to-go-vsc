# JSON to Go

#### This extension will let you convert <em>selected</em> text to a Go struct if it's valid JSON.

Can be run through the command pallete or the editor context menu inside configured languages with the <strong>JSON to Go</strong> command

Upon execution a temporary file will be opened and struct name will automatically be selected for easy renaming.

### Settings

You can choose inside which languages to show the context menu with the following setting: 
```json
"json-to-go.contextMenu.supportedLanguages": [
        "javascript",
        "typescript",
        "json",
        "jsonc",
        "html",
        "go"
    ]
```

Also there is a toggle to show the types inline:

```go
type Autogenerated struct {
	Employees []struct {
		Name string `json:"name"`
		Email string `json:"email"`
	} `json:"employees"`
}
```

Or below the main struct:
```go
type Autogenerated struct {
	Employees []Employee `json:"employees"`
}
type Employee struct {
	Name string `json:"name"`
	Email string `json:"email"`
}
```
